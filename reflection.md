This IDP was my first computer science project. I struggled a lot with learning about functions, arrays, loops, etc. I solved this problem by going to P5 reference to find the structure of what most functions look like so I could apply them to my projects. I created a project that could change colors when the space bar is pressed and has squares. In this project, I mainly used the draw function because it was easier to learn and the coordinates were easier to work with as opposed to other functions I was still not experience enough to work with yet. I did not know much about javascript before this project and mostly worked with simple coding before this. This project helped me set the foundation for future projects and gave me a general sense of computer science as a whole.
